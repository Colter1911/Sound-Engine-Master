# SEM (Sound Engine Master)

## Overview

**SEM (Sound Engine Master)** is a Foundry VTT module that replaces the built-in audio workflow.

If you've used Foundry's default playlists, you know their limitations: no proper channel management, files added one at a time, and finding the right track mid-session is an adventure in itself. SEM is a full-featured audio tool designed to be used right at the table.

- **Engine.** A custom audio engine running alongside Foundry's Audio API. Rich, full-bodied sound that Foundry's standard tools simply can't deliver. Eliminates stuttering on heavy tracks, zero network load when idle. Synchronization ensures that players hear exactly what the GM hears.

- **Mixer.** Full channel control: faders, playlists, seeking. You can build queues for each game in advance — ambient, music, SFX — and switch between them in a single action instead of digging through files mid-combat. Sync OFF mode lets you preview tracks in your headphones and pick the right moment to bring them in, without broadcasting to players early.

- **Import & Organization.** Drag-n-drop folders straight from your file manager — 10, 50, 100 files at once. You can assign tags on import, and they'll automatically apply to every added track. Drag tracks between playlists, organize tags. Library management that used to take hours now takes minutes.

- **Migration.** Existing playlists from standard Foundry transfer over by drag-and-drop. SEM doesn't just copy links — it converts everything into its own database with global search, filtering, and processing. Nothing is lost, only gained in quality and convenience.

- **Effects.** Real-time audio processing. Ready-made presets for common scenarios — "Cathedral" (reverb + delay), "Underwater" (low-pass filter) — or build your own chain from modules: compressor, distortion, equalizer, and more.

- **Library.** Search by tags (`#Horror #Tension #Rain`) instead of file names. Global search across your entire collection, channel filtering, active playlist highlighting. You always know where to find the sound you need.
