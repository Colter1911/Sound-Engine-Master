🎧 SEM (Sound Engine Master)
The Audio Engine Your Game Deserves.

Visuals are the body of your story. Sound is its soul.
You spend hours preparing maps, tokens, and lighting, but audio in Foundry VTT has always been an afterthought. Clunky folders, a primitive player, and endless file management kill the immersion.
SEM changes the rules. It is not just a player. It is a professional sound station built directly into Foundry VTT.

🔥 Why SEM?

⚡ Not Just a Module — A New Engine

SEM utilizes a modern audio engine that runs parallel to and independent of the standard Foundry Audio API.
Stability: Zero stuttering, even when loading heavy scenes or tracks.
Quality: Deep, volumetric sound that standard Foundry tools cannot achieve.
Performance: Zero network load when idle. Smart synchronization ensures your players hear exactly what you hear, instantly.

🎛️ Mixer, Not a List

Feel like a Sound Engineer, not a librarian.
Pro Control: Flexible management of every channel. Faders, Mute/Solo, and Seeking — everything is at your fingertips.
Queues: Prepare ambient, music, and SFX for each scene in advance. No more panic-searching for the right file during combat.
Headphones Mode (Sync OFF): Find the perfect moment to drop the beat. Preview tracks locally without spoiling them for your players.

🚀 Industrial Scale Drag-n-Drop

Forget adding files one by one.
Bulk Upload: Simply drag a folder from Windows/Mac directly into the module. 10, 50, 100 tracks at once? Easy.
Auto-Tagging: Want to add a "Combat Music" pack? Open a playlist, set tags like #Battle #Epic, and drag your files in. SEM automatically applies these tags to all new tracks. Organizing your library takes seconds.

📦 Seamless Migration

Afraid of losing years of work on your playlists?
Smart Import: SEM respects your time. Drag your existing Foundry playlists and sounds into the module in one motion.
Transformation: The module doesn't just copy links — it transforms your old "audio baggage" into a powerful new database structure with global search, filtering, and processing capabilities.

🎚️ FX Pedalboard

Atmosphere is created not just by music, but by space.
Live Processing: Apply effects in real-time.
Scenario Presets: Heroes enter a temple? Activate the "Cathedral" preset (Reverb + Delay). Diving underwater? Switch to "Underwater" (Low-pass filter).
Modular Design: Build your own unique FX chains using ready-made blocks (Compressor, Distortion, Equalizer, etc.).

🔎 Smart Library

Search by Mood: Don't look for track_05.mp3. Search for #Horror #Tension #Rain.
Global Access: Instant search across your entire gigabyte-sized collection.
Intuitive UI: Active playlist highlighting, channel filters, and full Drag-n-Drop control. You always know where your sound is.
